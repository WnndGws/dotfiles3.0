# dotfiles3.0
Managed by dotgit

<++> WIP

- Situation 01: Have computer with dotfiles that need saving
    - Set up dotgit
    ```
    $ mkdir ~/dotgit
    $ cd ~/dotgit
    $ dotgit init
    ````
    - Edit `filelist` as per `$ dotgit help`
    - Set up dotgit password using `$ dotgit passwd`
    - Edit 'crytplist' as per `$ dotgit help`
    - Encrypt and update
    ```
    $ dotgit update (ctgs)
    $ dotgit encrypt
    $ dotgit generate
    ```

I have not dealt with these two yet
- Situation 02: Have computer where want copy dotfiles from dotgit
- Situation 03: Have edited dotfiles on Computer01 and want to copy them to Computer02
